                    </h1>
                    <h2>Overview:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Chat App is like it says on the tin, an appilcation for chatting between two users. 
                        The application is built with React Native and is designed that a user can upload images, 
                        take photon on your phone and as well use Google Maps to share your location.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Purpose & Context:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Chat App is a personal project that I built through CareerFoundry Full-Stack course. 
                        The application is built with React Native since the main purpose of the application is to be able to have a chat function and use one on the phone. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Objective:</h2>
                    <p>
                        The main objective of the project is to show my skills as an developer on my portfolio. 
                        Another thing is to get used to programming application for the mobile using ReactJS, 
                        as well connecting the mobile application to Firebase.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Approach:</h2>
                    <p>
                        The approach for the project is firstly to install all the dependencies. The main dependency we are using is Expo. This is to make React Native. 
                        With Expo installed we can use our own phone or an emulator to test our application. 
                        <br><br>
                        After building the application on on ReactJS, it's time to connect and authenticate with help of Firebase. 
                        With Firebase connected we can now save and load messages on the application. 
                        The next step after this is to configure Firebase so we can take photos, 
                        upload images and as well share your location with Google Maps. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                    <p>
                        There were two main challenges I faced during this project. The first challenge was to to make sure the layout of the app smooth and slick, 
                        especially when you switch pages and it did not want to apply correct background colour. 
                        It was for the most part easy to solve after some troubleshooting. The issue was I used the wrong constand to render the background colours. 
                        <br>
                        The second challenge was actually with configuration of Firebase. Somewhere during configuration of the Firebase the messages were saved and loaded as intented. 
                        However, the configuration of the function to take photos, upload images and sharing your location was not working properly. 
                        In the end the code was correct and the fault lied with the Firebase. Thus to solve this issue was to reconfigure Firebase again from scratch.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Duration:</h2>
                    <p>
                        This project was worked over a period of three to four weeks that I worked during the 
                        If you calculate the pure all the time I worked on the project it will amount to for about two days. 
                        Of course like previously mentioned it was spread out over three weeks. 
                        Reason for this is because the devloper Olof Jansson is working full time and thus only have the time on the evenings to work on.
                    </p>
